# @kurocado-studio/html-forms

## Overview

The project aims to create a robust form component handling library for React applications. To meet
this primary objective, several tools such as Conform and Zod have been adapted.

Our efforts focus on modern React development, with a view to providing open-source community
resources and reusable assets for future Kurocado Studio projects. We are also intent on ensuring
seamless integration with [Epic Stack](https://www.epicweb.dev/epic-stack).
