# Overview

Kurocado Studio specializes in web development with a focus on React. There is a need for a robust,
reusable form component that aligns with the company’s technological focus and standards. By
adopting Conform and Zod—tools recommended by Epic Web’s Professional Web Forms workshop—the
component will handle form state and validation efficiently. This development will standardize form
handling across projects, contribute valuable resources to the open-source community, and integrate
smoothly with the Epic Stack framework used at the studio.

## Risks & Mitigation

### Risk Identification

1. Developers may be unfamiliar with Conform, requiring time to learn its API and best practices.
2. Balancing project workload with job-hunting efforts may impact timelines.
3. Maintaining an open-source project adds additional responsibilities.
4. Scope Creep Potential for project scope to expand beyond initial plans.

### Mitigation Strategies

1. Set aside dedicated time for learning Conform through Epic Web’s Professional Web Forms workshop
   and other resources.
2. Use Agile sprints to prioritize tasks and set realistic deadlines. Employ time-blocking
   techniques to balance job hunting and project work.
3. Encourage community contributions to aid in maintenance. Use clear contribution guidelines and
   documentation.
4. Establish a well-defined project scope and adhere to it. Use a change control process for any
   scope adjustments.
