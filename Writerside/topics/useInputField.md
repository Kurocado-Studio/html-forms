The useInputFieldAdapter hook simplifies form input handling by combining React Ariaâ€™s accessibility
features with field state management from Conform.

## Key Functionality

- Field State Management: Utilizes useField from Conform to handle state, errors, and events.
- Accessibility: Leverages useTextField from React Aria to ensure ARIA attributes and accessibility
  standards.
- Merging Props: Combines additional input props using mergeProps for flexibility.

## Component Interaction Diagram

This diagram demonstrates the interaction between the different React Aria hooks (useTextField) and
Conform's useField in the useInputFieldAdapter.
